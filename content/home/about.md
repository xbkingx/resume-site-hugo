## Background

I received a PhD in Neuroscience from Brown University, where I focused on brain-computer interface research. Even though doctoral programs tend to lead students down a path of hyper-specialization, the multidisciplinary nature of neural interfaces, combined with my previous experiences as a pharmaceutical representative and technology journalist, have resulted in an undeniably unique and diverse skillset.

I'm currently seeking employment in a public or private organization fueled by massive, complex ideas at the intersection of perception, interaction, and technology.
