### Neuroscience Doctoral Candidate
#### Brown University <br> [BrainGate Project][1] <br> Dr. John P. Donoghue Lab
##### *Providence, RI <br> Aug. 2005 - May 2017*

* Investigated brain-computer interface safety and usability factors essential for transitioning BCI technology from a controlled lab environment to the outside world.
* Catalyzed project-wide changes to experimental design, post-implant initial evaluation, and participant instruction.
* Analyzed, validated, and verified high volume, high resolution neural data sets across large variable spaces for dissertation study and collaborating projects, requiring precise knowledge of signal conditioning, filtering, aligning, and processing.
* Defended thesis successfully without revision.
* Thesis title: Volitional Strategies Engaged During Neural Interface Control: The Impact of Watching, Imagining, and Attempting Movement on Neural Activity. [(Abstract)][2]
 * Designed behavioral task technical requirements and line of scientific questioning to compensate for two major BrainGate transitions. This parallel, independent implementation allowed thesis work to progress unaffected by major changes to the larger BrainGate project, while acting as an independent data validation resource for other subprojects during early development stages of the larger system.
 * Presented personal and project-wide research at department, local, national, and international venues.
 * Coordinated programming, data analysis, and experimental protocol for a subset of researchers within the BrainGate project.

### Pharmaceutical Representative
#### Abbott Laboratories
##### *Abbott Park, IL <br> Feb. 2002 - Apr. 2005*

* Liaised between medical professionals and company research divisions, providing medical information and resources related to company products.
* Drove territory regional ranking from bottom third to top 10%.
* Increased sales to 125% over quota annually.
* Developed Excel macros for physician data portability and prescription trend analysis featuring novel, effective methods of identifying key prescribers. Distributed macros and peer reviewed literature to coworkers.

### Neurophysiologist/Programmer
#### [Neural Signals, Inc.][3] <br> Dr. Philip R. Kennedy Lab
##### *Atlanta, GA <br> May 1999 - Feb. 2002*

* Broad duties, spanning all project facets, from working with participants to presenting to investors.
* Trained patients with advanced ALS and brainstem stroke to communicate through the first implanted human brain-computer interface.
* Implemented a fully mobile data analysis rack system.
* Designed and implemented programs to aid data collection and analysis.
* Collected and analyzed data leading to published findings.
* Recommended, purchased, installed, and configured all business applications, research software, and hardware.
* Created web site to solicit prospective investors and families of potential patients with degenerative diseases.
* Full-time position while full-time student.
